My name is Cyan Zhong, a first-year badger majoring in journalism and mass communication. 
I have a passion for writing and global culture, so I'm also pursueing a global culture certificate here in UW-Madison. I'm from Hefei, China. Hefei is a small city in Anhui Province, famous for its traditional architecture and cuisine. If you ever come to Hefei I can be your tour guide and introduce all the great features we have.

Aside from my academic life I also have a rich extra curricular experience. My engagements include AIESEC Madison, Slow Food UW, the Wisconsin Dance Marathon and Food Science club.
Outside of school I am a huge foodie. I love to eat, cook and learn about culinary arts. Cultural cuisine and food science and technology are my areas of interest.

I have a great hobby of picking up foreign languages because they will be useful when I travel abroad. So far I have learnt the basics of Spanish, German and Korean by myself. Traveling is a big part of my life, and my design for the page is adopting the style of National Geographic Magazine. I believe that traveling is the exploration of one's spiritual independence, and the tribute to the beauty of the world.On the right are snapshots of my life story, they record all the precious memories.</div></blockquote>
