<h2>Comments from TA Kit Hughes</h2>
 <p>"On the level of concept, I particularly liked images that used symbolism and your photograph of what was inside Hervin's pockets."</p>
 
 <p>"You telephoto images control focus very intently, while some of your more wild-angle images draw from detailed and complex backgrounds to contextualize your subject in very specific environments."</p>
 <p>"I like best the images where you strategically used red to draw our attention to Hervin's shirt(the eye-lash picture)or where Hervin's shirt was the only color at all in an image(the historical society), which again had the effect of drawing us right to him."</p></div>

<p>"The banister at the top gives us a nice break at the line of thirds, your face is a great focal point for us, and your arms lead us right to it, he motion of your leap contrasts really well with the more solid, but still flowing concrete stairs.However, the text at the top of the poster seems a little bit hard to recognize because of the font and color. Also, there are some minor problems with cropping your image, because we can see a little of the orginal background around your finger.Overall it's a well-structured poster and I particularly like your font choice of the caption.--Kit Hughes"</p>

My idea of this poster is to combine a moving figure in a still background, which conveys a balance of motion and stillness. The concept of my show is a series about teenage life in a high school, but this school has some magic power to turn students to the opposite direction that they wanted to go. I know that the concept of the show is not very well expressed, and I will try to improve my concept in future poster-making.--Cyan Zhong</div>
